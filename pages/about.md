Puck Rocks is a former Rock n Roll roadie who decided to ditch the grim grit of backstage for the glitz and glamour of live comedy.

Puck, like his midsummer night's namesake, brings a mischievous and confused humour to his sets, covering topics like solo parenthood, social politics, professional driving and what if your cat was in charge of negotiating your phone contract?
